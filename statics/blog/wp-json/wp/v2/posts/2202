Only certain immigrants can do this process, those who have a green card; which means they&#8217;re permanent residents. They can apply for 3 to 5 years or meet specific military service requirements.<\/p>\n<p>If you have a green card, you can apply for citizenship after being a five-year resident. It is the most common way people become US citizens.<\/p>\n<p>To qualify, you need to have lived in the US continuously for five years before you apply using Form N-400, Application for Naturalization. The Immigration and Nationality Act (Title III, Chapter 2) explains all the requirements for someone who&#8217;s been a permanent resident.<\/p>\n<p>It takes about nine months from applying for citizenship to becoming a citizen at the Oath of Allegiance ceremony. Let\u2019s talk about the advantages of US passports for permanent residents in the next section.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>What are the Advantages of US Passports for Permanent Residents?<\/h2>\n<p>Citizenship means being born to US citizens or completing the naturalization process.

You can download and print this form or fill it out online.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Show Proof of US Citizenship<\/h3>\n<p>You need to provide evidence of your US citizenship. If you&#8217;ve recently become a citizen through naturalization, you can use your Certificate of Naturalization. If you don&#8217;t have this certificate, you can use other documents.<\/p>\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https:\/\/travel.state.gov\/content\/travel\/en\/passports\/how-apply\/citizenship-evidence.html\">State Department&#8217;s Citizenship Evidence<\/a> for examples and tips on gathering your documents in the US citizenship application process.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Bring a Valid ID<\/h3>\n<p>You must also bring a valid form of identification and a photocopy of both sides (if the information is printed on the back). Commonly accepted IDs include:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>a state-issued driver&#8217;s license, or<\/li>\n<li>a current foreign passport.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Step 4: Get a Passport Photo<\/h3>\n<p>Your application must include a passport photo measuring 2 x 2 inches (51 x 51 mm).

After submitting your application, you can track its status online.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Applying for a Passport from Outside the US.<\/h3>\n<p>Getting a US passports for permanent residents outside the country works differently than applying from within the country. If you&#8217;re a US citizen living abroad, you&#8217;ll usually need to apply for your passport in person at a US Embassy or consulate.<\/p>\n<p>Each embassy or consulate has its own rules and processes for passport services. People living abroad can find more info on their country&#8217;s embassy or consulate website.<\/p>\n<p>The standard processing time for a passport application is currently 8 to 11 weeks. But if you have international travel plans coming up soon or need the passport faster, you can apply for an expedited passport by paying an extra $60 fee.<\/p>\n<p>Expedited passports take 5 to 7 weeks to process, starting when the government gets your application at a passport agency or center.<\/p>\n<p><img decoding=\"async\" class=\"alignnone wp-image-2206\" src=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/green-card-passport-arrangement-top-view-300x200.webp\" alt=\"US citizenship requirements\" width=\"1053\" height=\"702\" srcset=\"https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/green-card-passport-arrangement-top-view-300x200.webp 300w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/green-card-passport-arrangement-top-view-1024x683.webp 1024w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/green-card-passport-arrangement-top-view-768x512.webp 768w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/green-card-passport-arrangement-top-view-1536x1024.webp 1536w, https:\/\/abroadin.com\/blog\/wp-content\/uploads\/2024\/04\/green-card-passport-arrangement-top-view-2048x1365.webp 2048w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1053px) 100vw, 1053px\" \/><\/p>\n<h2>How to Renew US Passports for Permanent Residents?<\/h2>\n<p>US passports for adults usually last 10 years, while passports for kids under 16 are good for 5 years. Know when your passport expires and learn about the renewal process before it&#8217;s time to update it.<\/p>\n<p>While the steps might change depending on your situation, here&#8217;s the usual process for renewing your passport by mail at your nearest United States Post Office:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Step 1: Fill out the Renewal Application<\/h3>\n<p>Start by completing <a href=\"https:\/\/eforms.state.gov\/Forms\/ds82_pdf.pdf\">Form DS-82: US Passport Renewal Application for Eligible Individuals<\/a>. You can either do this on paper at the post office or online.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Step 2: Include Necessary Documents<\/h3>\n<p>Along with Form DS-82, you&#8217;ll need to send in:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Your most recent US passport book and card.<\/li>\n<li>A passport photo that meets the requirements.<\/li>\n<li>Certified copies of documents if your name has changed since your last passport.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Step 3: Pay Fees and Mail Your Application<\/h3>\n<p>You&#8217;ll need to pay the renewal fees with a personal check or money order, as online payments aren&#8217;t accepted for passport services.

Here are some essential things to know:<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Renouncing Other Citizenship<\/h3>\n<p>You might have to give up citizenship in other countries. Depending on your home country&#8217;s rules regarding dual citizenship (being a citizen of two countries at once), you might need to relinquish your citizenship when you become American.<\/p>\n<p>The US allows dual citizenship, but you&#8217;ll typically need to use your US passport for travel in and out of the country. Some countries, like Australia, Canada, and the UK, also allow dual citizenship. However, others, like India and Japan, may require you to give up their citizenship once you become American.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s wise to check your home country&#8217;s policy on dual nationality before applying for naturalization if you plan to keep your citizenship there.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Military Service<\/h3>\n<p>Although the draft for mandatory military service ended in 1973, it could be reinstated. If it does happen, as a US citizen or green card holder aged 18 to 25 who has lived in the US, you must register with the Selective Service System.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Jury Duty<\/h3>\n<p>In the US, serving on a jury when called is mandatory. You must attend if you receive a summons, although you might not ultimately serve. Only those chosen by the judge and attorneys after being summoned will serve on the jury.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Exemptions from Federal Jury Duty<\/h3>\n<p>Active-duty military personnel, professional firefighters and police officers, and some full-time public government officials are usually exempt from federal jury duty.<\/p>\n<p>Individuals who served on a federal jury in the past two years, those aged 71 and older, and volunteer first responders may request excused, but policies vary by district court.<\/p>\n<p>State and local courts have exemption rules based on age, disability, or public office positions.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Lifetime US Income Tax Filing Requirement<\/h3>\n<p>US citizens are required to file US income tax returns for life, regardless of where they reside.<\/p>\n<p>If you live abroad, you can exclude a portion of your income\u2014currently over $100,000\u2014from taxation if you meet specific requirements. Any income above this limit is usually subject to taxation.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h3>Scrutiny of Criminal History<\/h3>\n<p>Your criminal record will undergo a thorough examination during the naturalization process.<\/p>\n<p>If you&#8217;ve committed a crime that could lead to deportation, such as immigration fraud, drug offenses, or domestic violence, it&#8217;s crucial to seek legal advice before applying for citizenship.<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\n<p>Becoming a US citizen unlocks a path to more significant opportunities and civic engagement. From voting rights and unrestricted travel to federal benefits and job prospects, naturalization offers a complete chance to integrate into American life. However, this privilege comes with responsibilities like taxes and potential military service.
